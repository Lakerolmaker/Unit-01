# Unit-01

This is a bunch of programs that i wrote in my spare time. The programs all come from a desire to make Java easier for my self.
If you feel the same way then feel free to use it. There are no real reason for these programs to exist other for my enjoyment.

I made all these programs in a single project as it was easier for me to build upon what i had allready made.

** Note: some of these programs have their own reposetory that i made awhile ago, these are usaully not up to date.
